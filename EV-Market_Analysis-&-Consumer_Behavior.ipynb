    "##### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The electric vehicle (EV) market has experienced significant growth over the last decade, driven by environmental concerns, government policies, and advances in technology. However, the widespread adoption of EVs faces several challenges, including supply chain constraints, charging infrastructure limitations, and consumer reluctance. This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current EV market, supply chain dynamics, and consumer behaviors while presenting a neutral view of the advantages and disadvantages of EV adoption.\n",

    "##### **Objectives:**\n",
    "1. **EV Market Trends (2015-2030):** Analyze global EV market share and growth patterns from 2015 to 2030.\n",
    "2. **Supply Chain Analysis:** Investigate the EV supply chain with a focus on critical components such as batteries and semiconductors, and highlight existing bottlenecks and projected future challenges over the period.\n",
    "3. **Charging Infrastructure Growth (2015-2030):** Evaluate the growth and development of EV charging infrastructure during this period, identifying geographic disparities and potential gaps in future infrastructure needs.\n",
    "4. **Consumer Preferences:** Assess evolving consumer preferences and barriers to adoption, such as cost, range anxiety, and environmental concerns, examining shifts from 2015 to projected trends in 2030.\n",
    "5. **Pros & Cons:** Provide a balanced analysis of the advantages (e.g., environmental sustainability) and disadvantages (e.g., high initial costs) of EV adoption, considering both past trends and future projections.\n",
    "6. **Prescriptive Insights (2015-2030):** Offer data-driven recommendations for policymakers and industry stakeholders to overcome key barriers to adoption and support the continued growth of the EV market through to 2030.\n",
    "\n",

    "This notebook will apply a combination of descriptive, predictive, prescriptive, and geospatial analysis to achieve the outlined objectives. Data is drawn from industry reports, market research, and publicly available sources. The aim is to provide data-driven insights that can assist stakeholders—including governments, manufacturers, and consumers—in understanding the current state of the EV market and identifying potential strategies for its continued development."
